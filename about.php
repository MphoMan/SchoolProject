           Inifinity motive car dealership is a system build to deal with problems faced in
           buying car online. Financing The Car With The Financing Offered By The Dealer Is 
           Usually The Most Direct And Fastest Option, But It Does Not Have To Be The Most Recommended.
           <br>
           <br> 
           Generally, This Type Of Financing Comes From The Brand Itself Or From Associated Entities. 
           In The Past, This Type Of Financing Had The Worst Conditions (Interest Rates And Terms). 
           Currently, With The Need To Sell Vehicles Pressing More Than Ever,
          The Conditions Have Improved Substantially, The Drawback Is That The Loan Often Comes With A Series Of Insurances That Increase The Price. 
          The Good Thing Is That The Dealer Handles All The Paperwork.
